MyC (MC) is a buch of header only libraries to help with various tasks in C, focusing on very repetitive header stuff things.
The project is at a very start right now and I'll keep adding more stuff to it as it is needed/convinient.
This project doesn't really have an end goal, instead is more of a way for me to store and easially reuse headers for repetitive things.
I do not mind eventually using header only libraries to do some of the heavy lifting, but in the end I hope to have this as a stand alone set of headers.
Feel free to use all and any of this code!
